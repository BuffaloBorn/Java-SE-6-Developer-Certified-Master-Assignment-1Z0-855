/**
 * The <code>LockManager</code> class is responsible for handling multiple
 * concurrent clients accessing the data cache via <code>Data</code> class.
 * Before a client thread can update a record in the data cache it must first
 * obtain a lock on that record, and release the lock after it is finished. Any
 * attempt to lock a record that is already locked should cause the client
 * thread to give up the CPU i.e. wait, consuming no CPU cycles until the
 * desired resource becomes available
 *
 * All methods in this class are called from the <code>Data</code> class before
 * it modifies records in cache, all methods here are marked as synchronized.
 *
 * All methods in this class are package private, as it should only be called
 * from <code>Data</code> class within the db package
