/**
 * {@code Cache} is used to store in memory all contractor objects read from the
 * database file. When the application starts all records are read from disk
 * into this cache stored as {@code Subcontractor} objects. The {@code Data}
 * class is responsible for creating the cache on start up (and populating as a
 * result of this) and flushing it's contents back to disk when the application
 * terminates either normally or abnormally. From a design point of view the
 * purpose of this class is to provide better performance as there is less disk
 * I/O involved. It also guarantees data integrity as we can synchronize
 * directly on the singelton cache object when modifying records. Also as we are
 * not writing to disk in real time we avoid any bad writes say for example if
 * the I/O stream terminates abnormally.
 *
 * The cache does not store any information about where the records are
 * persisted in the database i.e. byte locations, it is purely used to hold
 * subcontractor data.
