/**
 * {@code SubcontractorCache} is used to store all contractor objects read from
 * the database file in memory. When the application starts all records are read
 * from disk into this cache stored as {@code Subcontractor} objects. The
 * {@code Data} class is responsible for creating the cache on start up (and
 * populating as a result of this) and flushing it's contents back to disk when
 * the application terminates either normally or abnormally. From a design point
 * of view the purpose of this class is to provide better performance as there
 * is less disk I/O involved. It also guarantees data integrity as we can
 * synchronize directly on the singleton cache object when modifying records.
 * Also as we are not writing to disk in real time we avoid any bad writes say
 * for example if the I/O stream terminates abnormally.
 *
 * The cache does not store any information about where the records are
 * persisted in the database i.e. byte locations, it is purely used to hold
 * subcontractor data.
