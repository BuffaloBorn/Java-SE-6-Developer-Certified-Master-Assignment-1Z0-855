/**
 * The {@code SubcontractorService} interface contains all business
 * functionality of the application. This interface has two implementations, one
 * for client mode and the other for standalone mode. The instantiation of
 * either is done at runtime based on whichever mode the application is started
 * with. The presentation layer accesses the business layer through this
 * interface, regardless of the implementation i.e. It doesn't know whether the
 * subcontractor records are being presented locally or remotely. The
 * functionality in this interface is similar to that of {@code DBMain} but
 * contains more abstraction and deals directly with Subcontractor Object DTOs
 * rather than string arrays
