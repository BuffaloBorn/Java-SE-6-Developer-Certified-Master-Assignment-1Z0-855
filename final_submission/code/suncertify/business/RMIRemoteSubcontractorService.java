 * service functionality resulting in no code duplication. The remote interface
 * contains a single method to start the server on a specific port. This is
 * implemented in this class by exporting this object (which is a
 * DefaultSubcontractorService object) to the RMI Registry thus making it
 * available to receive incoming requests from clients
