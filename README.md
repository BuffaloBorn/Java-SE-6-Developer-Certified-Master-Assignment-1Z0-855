Oracle Testing ID: OC1256324

This repository contains 2 jar files
1) runme.jar            -   Main application (You will need to specify the db-2x2.db file with this)
2) k_obrien_OCJD_final  -   Complete archive of the project including runme.jar and other folders. Final submission jar.

Project layout:
All source code can be found under the code directory, under suncertify package.

The docs directory contains javadocs, the initial instructions file, my design and implementaton decisions., and a userguide.

The tests directory contains a handful of quick tests that were mainly thrown together to prove various parts of the application worked on a larger functional level i.e. locking, reading from database, bookings etc. There are no unit tests as 1. Tests were not a requirement 2. Project time was limited 3. The code is straightforward enough so the quality areas i was more concerned with were higher functional requirements. (Of course thats not to say unit tests shouldn't have been used, I just chose not to).

The initial files directory contains the original files that I recieved when I download the project.

The version file is an Oracle requirement to describe what version of Java was used.

The 'db-2x2.db' file is the database file provided by Oracle, the application will ask for this file on startup.
